Endorsed libraries for OpenID4Java:

The JAR files under the lib/endorsed/ folder need to be copied under
your environment's endorsed libraries folder. If you are running a
webapplication under Apache Tomcat, this directory can be found at:

	JAVA_HOME/lib/endorsed
 or
	CATALINA_HOME/common/endorsed
	
For Apache Tomcat 6: Please copy the "endorsed" directory to "CATALINA_HOME"

For other application servers or environments, please consult their
documentation for configuring endorsed libraries.
